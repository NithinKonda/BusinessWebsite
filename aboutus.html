                    <h4>Where have we come from?
                        What is our History?</h4>
                    <p>In 2015, while working in the industry we visited different campuses for hiring drives. We realized that the students were not able to crack coding problems based on simple concepts of Data Structures & Algorithms. We did a market analysis and realized the unemployment rate stood at 80% due to substandard education and inexperienced graduates saturating the market. Hence, we felt the need to deliver quality education to the community and embarked on a mission to empower young engineering students who wanted to become better coders. <a href="#">READ MORE.</a></p>
